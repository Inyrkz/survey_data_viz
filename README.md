# Data Analysis and Visualization for a Survey Platform

Building a data analysis tool for a survey platform.

The tool will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the survey data. It will also apply natural language processing (NLP) to correct text data of open-ended questions and extract the sentiment of the users.

For univariate analysis, it will create a histogram, boxplot and violin plot for numerical data. It will create bar graphs and pie charts for categorical data.
